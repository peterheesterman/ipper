# ipper

Said `ip - per`.

A command line tool made for my enjoyment that tells you the country in which an IP is registered.

ipper '163.172.132.119' -> 'France'

ipper -s '163.172.132.119' -> [sentence result]

ipper -v '163.172.132.119' -> All meta data

## Todo:

    - Add tests & flow typing
    - Show all the ways of using it
    - Add a help command
    - Chalk the output
    - Transpile so that i can use it more places (currently needs node version `7.6.0+`)
